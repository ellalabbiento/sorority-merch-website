            <h2>My Journey with Sorority Life</h2>
            <img src="https://www.northwestern.edu/fsl/images/updated-chapter-placards/pha-placards/alpha-phi.jpg" alt="Alpha Phi Logo" style="width:2in; height:2in;">
            <p>I am a sophomore in Alpha Phi at Miami University, and I absolutely love Greek life! Being a part of a sorority has not only helped me create lasting friendships but has also inspired my passion for designing and selling sorority merch.</p>
            <p>As a Marketing and Emerging Technologies in Business and Design major, I believe that sorority merch is a convenient and stylish way to represent our sisterhood, especially in the winter months. Who doesn't love to throw on a cozy hoodie or t-shirt for class?</p>
            <p>Additionally, I am a strong believer in uplifting women through the support and love of the Panhellenic community. My vision for this business is to not only grow but also to offer bulk orders for entire sororities, host giveaways, and create sponsorship opportunities.</p>

            <h3>Favorite Items:</h3>
            <ul>
                <li><b>T-Shirts</b>: Comfortable and stylish</li>
                <li><i>Hoodies</i>: Perfect for chilly days</li>
                <li><u>Accessories</u>: Add a fun touch to any outfit</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>Future Goals</h3>
            <table>
                <tr>
                    <th>Goal</th>
                    <th>Details</th>
                </tr>
                <tr>
                    <td>Bulk Orders</td>
                    <td>Partner with entire sororities for custom orders.</td>
                </tr>
                <tr>
                    <td>Giveaways</td>
                    <td>Organize events for our sorority members.</td>
                </tr>
            </table>

            <p>Throughout my journey in Greek life, I've learned the importance of collaboration and support. I am always looking for ways to engage with fellow sorority sisters, whether through events or shared projects. This collaborative spirit drives my business approach and inspires me to create a community-focused brand.</p>
